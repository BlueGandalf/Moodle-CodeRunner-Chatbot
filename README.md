# Moodle-CodeRunner-Chatbot
Report and Presentation prepared as part of my Summer Placement with Loughborough University.

During this project, the CodeRunner plugin was used to implement a chatbot solution into Moodle. This involved the setting up of several Virtual Machines to test and prototype the system. The chatbot itself was written in python, and python was also used in the CodeRunner plugin to organise the knowledge base, query the chatbot and format the responses.

Code produced for this project is owned by Loughborough University.
